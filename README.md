
This package contains a `Julia` version of the Reiter's Projection+Perturbation method to solve
heterogeneous agents models in presence of aggregate uncertainty. I consider two main applications

* [Krusell-Smith Model](doc\ReiterJEDCinJulia.pdf)
* [State Dependent Pricing](doc\SDPricing.pdf)

Check the
[jupyter notebook](jupyter\KrusellSmithJulia.ipynb) for a demonstration of Krusell-Smith application.
For a detailed description of the method and particular applications check the user guides.
