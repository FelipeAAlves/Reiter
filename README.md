
This package contains a `Julia` code to solve heterogeneous agent model with aggregate uncertainty
based on the Matlab code accompanying [Reiter (2009)](http://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/eco/es-258.pdf)
“*Solving heterogeneous-agent models by projection and perturbation*”.

Specifically, I have the code for two standard models featuring heterogeneity

* [Krusell-Smith Model](doc/ReiterJEDCinJulia.pdf)
* [State Dependent Pricing](doc/SDPricing.pdf)

Check the [jupyter notebook](jupyter/KrusellSmithJulia.ipynb) for a demonstration of Krusell-Smith application.
For a detailed description of the method and particular applications check the user guides.
