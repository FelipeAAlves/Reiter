
This package contains `Julia` code to solve heterogeneous agent models with aggregate uncertainty.

The models are solved using Reiter's Projection + Perturbation approach. The implementation is heavily based on the Matlab code accompanying [Reiter (2009)](http://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/eco/es-258.pdf) *"Solving heterogeneous-agent models by projection and perturbation"*.

Specifically, I have two examples of economies featuring heterogeneity

* [Krusell-Smith Model](doc/ReiterJEDCinJulia.pdf)
* [State Dependent Pricing](doc/SDPricing.pdf)

Check the [jupyter notebook](jupyter/KrusellSmithJulia.ipynb) for a preview of the code in the context of Krusell-Smith model.
For a detailed description of the method check the user guides.
