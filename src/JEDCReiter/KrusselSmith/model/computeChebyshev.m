% Computes Chebyshev polynomials up to order "nPower," evaluated along "vGrid"
%
% Inputs
%   (1) nPower: order of polynomial
%	(2) vGrid: points along which to compute polynomials (must be column vector)
%
% Outputs
%   (1) mPoly: nGrid x nPower matrix of polynomials; entry (i,j) is the j_th order
%		Chebyshev polynomial evaluated at vGrid(i)
