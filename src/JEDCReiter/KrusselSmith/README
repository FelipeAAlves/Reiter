INSTALLATION

1) Install the CompEcon toolbox of Miranda Fackler
(http://www4.ncsu.edu/~pfackler/compecon/toolbox.html)

2) Unpack appraggr.tar.gz in a separate directory, for example
c:/matlab/appraggr

Check whether the paths set in setpaths.m are correct
(if your install directory is not c:/matlab/appraggr,
you have to change that; also look for the directory
where the Miranda/Fackler toolbox was installed)


SOLVING THE GROWTH MODEL

1) Change into the "growth" subdirectory

2) To solve with almost-exact aggregation,
and do the accuracy checks, 
run the script "solvegrowth.m"

3) Solving with the Krusell/Smith algorithm is coming soon!
(version 0.20 of )

4) Model reduction in state space form is coming soon!
